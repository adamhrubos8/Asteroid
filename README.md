requiered modules: pygame, random, copy, sys, json, math, time - most of them are usually included in python package
this project is working, but has some parts that have to be improved/finished

to run game create folder Asteroid in your computer (must have capital "A") and place there everything from "data" folder except .gitkeep file,
this file is here because of github
than place in same folder the version of game you want to play (we dont guarantee that anything from old_version folder will work)

the game is only avaliable in slovak language (some phrases like GAME OVER are in english)
